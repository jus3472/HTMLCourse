<!-- 
  <info> is an opening tag and </info> is a closing tag for it. some tags are just <info/> and are called self-closing tags. These tags are used for items that don't contain content and thus don't need a closing tag. Technically, all self-closing tags can still have an opening and closing tag instead (but it is not standard practice), but regular opening and closing tags like <div>info</div> cannot be self-closing. All self closing tags like <info/> can also just be written like <info> but it's not standard practice.

  When dealing with nested tags, you can never have <<. Every < must be followed by a >. A correct nested tag is: 
  <a><abbr>hello</abbr></a>
  -->

<!-- 
  What is an HTML element? It consists of a opening tag, content, and a closing tag. For example, <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  The <p> is an opening tag, "This is a paragraph" is the content, and </p> is the closing tag.
-->

<!--
  What is an attribute? It is additional info about an element, specifying properties or behavior that is not standard to the element alone. They are always placed in the opening tag and often consist of a name-value pair formatted as name="value". They modify the default behavior of elements. <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
  In this example, there is an anchor opening tag and a closing tag with content inside of it. There is also an attribute inside the opening tag that modifys the element. It specifies the URL to which the link points.
-->

<!--
  What is semantic? A tag or attribute is semantic if it doesn't affect the way the site looks but just helps browsers and assistive technologies. header, main, footer, article, aside, section, nav, etc are all semantic. <h1> to <h6> are headings and have different font sizes. However, they are mainly semantic and their sizes and other features can be completely changed with CSS.
  Div is not semantic but is also a tag that is used to group elements. Typically, you assign it an id or class so you can style and script it. It doesn't provide any SEO like semantic tags. It is recommended to use semantic tags when you can, although you can use div if you are lazy.
-->

<!--
  An id attribute is unique and used to identify a single element. To access it, use the # symbol.
  A class attribute can be used by multiple elements to group them. You can't href to a class because there can be multiple elements with the same class.
