HTML Tips:

* <!DOCTYPE html> is a declaration that specifies the HTML version.
* HTML code typically consists of an opening <html> tag, followed by <head> and <body> tags.
* The <head> section contains meta information about the HTML document, such as the title, character encoding, and viewport settings.
* Meta tags are used to provide additional information about the HTML document, such as the author, description, keywords, etc.
* The overarching term for elements like <title> and <link> is "HTML tags" or "HTML elements."
* An HTML element can refer to a single tag or a group of tags and their content between opening and closing tags.
* The order of elements in the head section generally doesn't matter, but there may be some dependencies.
* In tags like <meta name="viewport" content="...">, the attribute name is fixed, while the value of the content attribute can vary.
* An attribute in HTML provides additional information about an element and is written within the opening tag.
* Empty tags like <meta> cannot have closing tags, while paired tags like <title> require both opening and closing tags.
* The choice of paired or empty tags is determined by the HTML specification and the specific element's purpose.
* Semicolons are not typically used in HTML. They are commonly used in CSS and JavaScript for separating statements.
* The ampersand symbol & is used in HTML for character entities and special character encoding.
* <abbr> is an HTML tag used to define an abbreviation or acronym and can be paired with the <title> attribute to provide additional information.
* <ol> is an ordered list tag, and <li> is a list item tag used within ordered and unordered lists.
* A container in HTML is an element that holds and organizes other elements and their content.
* <h1> is a heading tag used to denote the main heading or title of a section or page.
* <p> is a paragraph tag used for defining paragraphs of text, and <address> is used to represent contact information.
* The ampersand symbol & in HTML is used to begin character entities or special character encoding.
* <dl>, <dt>, and <dd> are HTML tags used to create definition lists, where <dt> represents the term being defined and <dd> represents the definition.
* <a href="...">...</a> is an anchor tag used to create hyperlinks, where the href attribute specifies the URL or destination of the link.
* The target="_blank" attribute in an anchor tag is used to open the linked content in a new browser tab or window.
* Other values for the target attribute in addition to _blank include _self, _parent, and _top.
* Attributes are used to provide additional information or modify the behavior of HTML elements.
* Some other examples of HTML attributes include src, alt, class, id, style, width, height, etc.
* An attribute in HTML is a name-value pair that provides additional information or modifies the behavior of an element.
* The anchor tag <a> has multiple attributes, including href, target, title, rel, etc.
* Not every HTML element has multiple attributes, but many elements have multiple attributes available for customization.
* The anchor element <a> does not require the href attribute in all cases, but it is commonly used for creating hyperlinks.
* The anchor element <a> is an HTML element used to create hyperlinks or define interactive elements.
* Multiple attributes can be included within the same opening tag of an HTML element.
* Not all HTML elements have multiple attributes, but many elements have more than one attribute available for customization.
* HTML provides semantic elements that give meaning and structure to the content of a webpage.
* Semantic tags like <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, <footer>, etc., clarify the purpose and structure of different sections on a webpage.
* Semantic tags do not directly affect the appearance or behavior of the website; they primarily assist search engines, screen readers, and developers in understanding the content.
* The <figure> element is used to encapsulate self-contained content, typically an image, along with an optional caption using the <figcaption> element.
* Semantic tags contribute to better accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO) by providing meaningful structure and context to the content.
* The <table>, <tr>, and <td> elements are used to create tables in HTML, where <tr> represents a table row and <td> represents a table cell.
* The <thead> element is used to group header content in a table, while the <tfoot> element groups footer content.
* The <th> element is used for table headers and is typically bold and centered, while <td> is used for regular table data.
* The rowspan attribute in a table cell (<td> or <th>) specifies the number of rows it should span vertically.
* The <label> element is used to associate a text label with a form element, like an <input> element, using the for attribute and the id attribute.
* The for attribute in a <label> element should match the id attribute of the associated form element to establish the association.
* The name attribute in an <input> element is used to define the name of the form field, which is sent with the form data when submitted.
* The autocomplete attribute in an <input> element suggests whether the browser should enable autocomplete suggestions for that input field.
* The list attribute in an <input> element associates it with a <datalist> element, providing a list of predefined options for autocompletion.
* The value attribute in <option> elements within a <datalist> specifies the value to be sent or processed when a particular option is selected.
* The order of elements, such as placing a <label> before or after an <input> element, does not affect the functionality as long as the association is correctly established using the for and id attributes.
